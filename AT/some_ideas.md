1. Page 210, Algebra I of Artin, proposition 7.9.2, there is only one reduced form of a given word w.  
Restate the proof. We think of cancellation of a given word w as a prosses step by step. In each step, we cancellate one pair. Note that after this, a new cancellation pair may appear. What matters and may induce different results of a reduced form is the order of cancellation, i.e., the choice of cancellation pair we choose of each step. We want to show that, this choice of order of steps in cancellation does not matter, i.e., for any reduced form (since we have not proved that there is just one reduced form, we should assume that there maybe many of them) of a given word w, we can choose an arbitary cancellation pair as our first step. If we proved this, then for any given word w, we can just choose the first left cancellation pair in each step and get the unique reduced form. In Artin's proof, for a reduced form, our pair is either cancelled or not. If it is not cancelled, then it must be the case of xx^-1x. If it is cancelled, then the order of this cancel does not matter, however, this claim needs some careful thought.
2. Page 25, example, Linear Homotopy. This should be applied to R^n only, instead of a general topological space. Since each function is timed by a scalar t (or 1-t). This will not make sence if t (or 1-t) is timed by a function from I to a topological space.
