Homotopy Class: The equivalence class of paths up to homotopy equivalence.
Proposition 1.6: The point of this proof is that the fundamental group states on loops (which defines the simply-connencted space) while the proposition states on paths. The proof states the equivalence of these tw concepts.
Theorem 1.9: The construction of r, from h(x) to r(x) is crucial, so that if x on S^1 is mapped to another y on S^1, r(x) will be x instead of h(x), which complies with the continuity.
